Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 12.981 is 3.731(28.7%) logic and 9.250(71.3%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 16.772 is 5.506(32.8%) logic and 11.266(67.2%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value
